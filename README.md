DISCLAIMER:

If you're on PC and you do not have a second monitor, I recommend you play in a small window, like 800x600.
This is because when you're alt tabbed, UMVC3 still reads mouse input, and this mouse input can cause the game to constantly read arrow key movement, making menuing impossible. 


DESCRIPTION:

This is an Archipelago Manual Randomizer for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.


In this randomizer, you are going to start off with a random mode and three random characters. As you play, you will find more character keys and mode keys. 
The goal of the randomizer is to complete a challenge in every mode available. 
When you complete these challenges, you will be rewarded with a "stone"; a mcguffin which, when gathered will allow you to play Galactus Mode. You win the game when you beat Galactus Mode.

The available modes and their respective challenges are as follows:
Versus mode (Local & Online play is fine): Win a game with 15 different characters, after that win a game playing random all
Arcade mode - Beat the game with 15 characters
Training mode - Deal 1,250,000 damage without X-Factor or Level 3s or Level 5s
Mission mode (TBA) - Clear mission 10 with 15 different characters (?)

Depending on if people want it, I can incorporate Heroes and Heralds into the manual but otherwise I won't bother.

You can also find different difficulty modes along the way, but these are unimportant to progression.

Here are all the ways you can earn items outside of the previously mentioned ways:
* Versus mode: Win a game with every character.
* Arcade mode: K.O any opponent, K.O any opponent with a level 1 Hyper Combo, K.O any opponent with a level 3 Hyper combo (& Phoenix's Level 5), a character's win screen and Beat Arcade mode with a character.
* Training mode: Deal 1,250,000, X-Factor is allowed. There's two types of these locations: one where level 3 Hyper combos are allowed and one where they aren't allowed.
* Every Galactus mode stage will also have a location check, just to make going through the mode more interesting.

Toggleable options:
You can disable any mode you wish (broken at the moment; will be fixed next update), and you can also disable the DLC characters in case you can't access them

Major issues
* You you cannot disable any modes, doing so will make generating a game fail.


Previously Asked Questions: 
*Who gets credit for the training mode checks?
Go about it however you think it should be, or whatever sounds more fun to you. 
Me personally, I credit it to whoever started the combo, as for some characters most of the damage will have to come from a strong damage engine like Spencer or Vergil
